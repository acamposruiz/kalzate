The Octo Query Language, a DSL for fetching Github issues. Try it out [here]().

## Overview

OctoQL is an sql-like query language to help you fetching Github repository issues easier. The main purpose was to provide myself and the audience [reading me]() (or attending my [talk]()) with a real case scenario example about how to craft a DSL from scratch and the different steps involved in the process. OctoQL looks like this.

```sql
// What do I need to work in today ?
from tsur/octoql
take 5
assignedTo me
order by priority   

// Too much information ..., just a quick view
from tsur/octoql
take 5
assignedTo me
order by priority
select title

// Something really urgent that requires my attention ?
from tsur/octoql
take veryImportant

// Those issues probably can be fixed later ...
from tsur/octoql
take !veryImportant

// Those issues probably can be closed ...
from tsur/octoql
take !important

// Ok, but I want higher control ...
from tsur/octoql
select title, status
where labels contains "p1" and labels not contains "merged"
```
